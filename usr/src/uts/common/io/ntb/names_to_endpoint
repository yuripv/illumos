# This file contains a list of endpoint names and the endpoint ids
# to which they are mapped.
#
# It allows drivers to reference endpoints by name and provides a central
# collection of endpoint ids. This file should be the same on both
# systems on either side of the bridge.
#
# Each line is a single entry, the first portion is the text string
# to be referenced by the driver, followed by white space(s) and then
# the integer endpoint id. Currently, the range of valid endpoints ids is
# 0 <= id <= 255.
#
# For example:
#	checksum-test		254		Used for integrity tests
#	performance-test	255		Used by throughput tests

# Reserve a range for use by drivers which may cause critical failures
# should this file not be present. E.g. entb driver will use endpoint_ids
# which correspond to its instance number.
